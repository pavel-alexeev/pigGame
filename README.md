# Pig Game

<p>Current games goal is to score at least 100 points throwing dice. Player who does that first, wins the game. You can throw dice multiple times, but as soon as you will press "Hold" button your current scores will be added to your total score and next player will have his turn. <strong>Remember:</strong> As soon as you throw dice on number 1 side, your current score will become 0, and then the next player makes his move.</p>
<p>New game always starts with Player 1 move.</p>
